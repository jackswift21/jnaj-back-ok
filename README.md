# jack-needs-a-job-2

Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).

This application is to help find Jack a remote coding job. A really nice guy at UofH liked the idea and the name so much, he asked me "so what happens once you get a job? are you going to leve the site up?". My response was "well...yeah". Then he says "it should help others find jobs too". I said "but bro, that would put in direct competition with like Indeed, and other big wigs in this game already. I just need it to show I can code, so I can get to the bread." Then he says, "but if it works for you bro...". So, this may turn into a job-finder for other out-of-work coders like myself. Shoutout to the that, can't remember his name, but if this goes anywhere, I owe him a beer or two.
